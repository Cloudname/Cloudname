/**
 * This class implements the main dispatcher for LogEvents.
 *
 * Right now this class is really primitive and probably won't offer
 * much in terms of performance or safety features.  The dispatcher
 * has an incoming queue of a fixed size.
 *
 * TODO(borud): acknowledgement of log events with elevated
 *   consistency level is very rudimentary and probably inefficient at
 *   the moment.  Each logevent is ack'ed separately and we make no
 *   use of the underlying protocol's ability to batch several
 *   acknowledgements into one response.
 *
 *   There is also a corner case for dispatchers that have no
 *   handlers: if a dispatcher has no handlers the message has not
 *   been persisted.  We probably need to extend the EventHandler
 *   interface so that the handle() method can return something that
 *   says if the handler persisted the message or not.  If at least
 *   one handler says it has persisted the message then we can
 *   consider it persisted.  If no handlers persisted the message, we
 *   should perhaps send back some kind of negative acknowledgement
 *   indicating this.
